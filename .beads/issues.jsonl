{"id":"nvim-beads-1x2","title":"Document search command and API in help docs","description":"## Context\n\nWith the search functionality being built on the execute infrastructure (commit 5f0ea69c), we need comprehensive documentation for both the `:Beads search` command and the `search()` public API.\n\n## Files to Update\n\n1. **doc/nvim-beads.txt** - Main help documentation\n2. **README.md** - User-facing documentation (if search is mentioned)\n3. **doc/beads-execute.txt** - May need minor updates to mention search as an example\n\n## Documentation Sections Needed\n\n### 1. Command Documentation (doc/nvim-beads.txt)\n\nAdd `:Beads search` command documentation following the pattern of `:Beads list` and `:Beads ready`:\n\n```\n:Beads search {query}                                    *:Beads-search*\n    Search for issues matching {query}. The query can be multiple words.\n    \n    Optional filters can be placed before the query:\n    - Status filter: open, closed, in_progress, blocked\n    - Type filter: bug, bugs, feature, features, task, tasks, epic, epics, chore, chores\n    \n    Examples: \u003e\n        :Beads search refactor database\n        :Beads search open refactor database\n        :Beads search bugs authentication\n        :Beads search open bugs login\n\u003c\n    Results are displayed in a Telescope picker with the same keybindings\n    as |:Beads-list|.\n    \n    Syntactic sugar: Status and type filters can appear anywhere before\n    the query terms and in any order.\n```\n\n### 2. Public API Documentation (doc/nvim-beads.txt)\n\nAdd `search()` function documentation in the Lua API section:\n\n```\nnvim_beads.search({query}, {opts})                       *nvim_beads.search()*\n    Search for issues matching {query}.\n    \n    Parameters: ~\n        {query}  (string) Search query (required, must be non-empty)\n        {opts}   (table|nil) Optional filters:\n                   • status: Filter by status (e.g., \"open\", \"closed\")\n                   • type: Filter by issue type (e.g., \"bug\", \"feature\")\n    \n    Examples: \u003e\n        require('nvim-beads').search('database migration')\n        require('nvim-beads').search('authentication', {status = 'open'})\n        require('nvim-beads').search('login bug', {type = 'bug', status = 'open'})\n\u003c\n    See also: |nvim_beads.list()|, |nvim_beads.execute_with_ui()|\n```\n\n### 3. Execute Command Documentation Updates\n\nUpdate **doc/beads-execute.txt** to include search as a prominent example:\n\n```\nExamples: \u003e\n    :Beads execute list --status open\n    :Beads execute search authentication bug\n    :Beads execute ready --priority 1\n    :Beads execute show bd-123\n\u003c\n```\n\n### 4. README Updates\n\nIf README.md mentions available commands, add search:\n\n```markdown\n- `:Beads search {query}` - Search for issues (with optional status/type filters)\n```\n\n## Key Points to Document\n\n1. **Query is required** - Unlike list/ready, search must have query terms\n2. **Filter flexibility** - Filters can appear anywhere before query terms\n3. **Plural forms supported** - 'bugs' works the same as 'bug'\n4. **Telescope integration** - Results appear in same picker as list/ready\n5. **Relationship to execute** - Mention that `search` can also be used via `:Beads execute search ...`\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `:Beads search` command documented in doc/nvim-beads.txt\n- [ ] `nvim_beads.search()` API documented in doc/nvim-beads.txt\n- [ ] Examples show both simple and filtered searches\n- [ ] Examples show filter order flexibility\n- [ ] Cross-references to related commands (list, ready, execute)\n- [ ] Error cases documented (missing query)\n- [ ] README updated if it lists commands\n- [ ] Help tags work (`:help :Beads-search`, `:help nvim_beads.search()`)\n\n## References\n\n- See nvim-beads-766 for pattern of documenting public API\n- See existing `:Beads list` documentation for command doc pattern\n- See doc/beads-execute.txt for execute command documentation","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-07T10:14:33.334018768-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T10:22:28.271533435-07:00","closed_at":"2025-12-07T10:22:28.271533435-07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"nvim-beads-1x2","depends_on_id":"nvim-beads-azf","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-07T10:14:33.344941379-07:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"nvim-beads-1x2","depends_on_id":"nvim-beads-mbx","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-07T10:14:33.346967228-07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Create a new directory: `lua/nvim-beads/issue/`.\n2.

All existing unit tests in the `spec/` directory must pass after the refactoring. Tests related to the old `issue.lua` module will need to be updated to reflect the new file structure.\n2.  Perform manual end-to-end testing of the core user workflows:\n    -   Creating a new issue (`:Beads create task`).\n    -   Saving the new issue buffer to trigger creation via `bd`.\n    -   Opening an existing issue (`:Beads open \u003cid\u003e`).\n    -   Modifying and saving an existing issue to trigger an update.\n    -   Listing issues via Telescope (`:Beads list`).","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"Claude","created_at":"2025-12-01T20:51:58.862730092-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-02T18:10:15.198388238-07:00","closed_at":"2025-12-02T18:10:15.198388238-07:00"}

Examines the text under the cursor\n2. If it matches an issue ID pattern (based on the prefix used in the current repository), execute the equivalent of `:Beads show \u003cissue-id\u003e` to open that referenced issue\n\n## Motivation\n\nIssue buffers frequently reference other issues in:\n- The `parent:` field in YAML frontmatter\n- The `dependencies:` list in YAML frontmatter  \n- The description, design notes, or acceptance criteria sections\n\nCurrently, navigating to these referenced issues requires manually copying the ID and running `:Beads show \u003cid\u003e`. This breaks flow and is tedious. A simple Enter-to-follow mapping would make navigating issue relationships much more ergonomic.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **Following parent issues**: User is viewing a subtask and wants to see the parent epic - cursor on `parent: nvim-beads-42`, press Enter, parent issue opens\n2. **Checking dependencies**: User is reviewing blocked work and wants to see what's blocking it - cursor on a dependency ID in the list, press Enter, dependency opens\n3. **Exploring design references**: Description mentions \"see nvim-beads-7 for background\" - cursor on the ID, press Enter, background issue opens","design":"## Technical Design\n\n### Implementation Location\n\nSet buffer-local keymap in `buffer.lua:populate_beads_buffer()` after line 25\n- Ensures mapping exists for both new and existing issue buffers  \n- Keeps buffer setup logic centralized\n\n### Prefix Detection\n\nGet repo prefix via `bd list --all --limit 1`, extract prefix from returned issue ID (e.g., \"nvim-beads\" from \"nvim-beads-7g8\")\n\nCritical: Must work for new issue buffers (`beads://issue/new?type=...`) which don't have an ID in the URL\n\n### Pattern Matching\n\n- Use `vim.fn.expand(\"\u003ccWORD\u003e\")` to get word under cursor (includes hyphens)\n- Match pattern: `\u003cprefix\u003e-[a-zA-Z0-9]+`\n- Must escape prefix with `vim.pesc()` for special regex characters\n- Must handle YAML list syntax (`- \u003cid\u003e`) and field values (`parent: \u003cid\u003e`)\n\n### Key Decisions\n\n1. **Notification on miss**: Show warning if no ID found under cursor, or silent failure?\n    * Silent failure is fine.\n2. **Module extraction**: Inline in buffer.lua or extract to navigation.lua?

{"id":"nvim-beads-77q","title":"Support :e and :e! commands to reload beads buffers from authoritative source","description":"## Feature Request\n\nEnable `:e` and `:e!` commands to work in beads issue buffers (`beads://issue/\u003cid\u003e`) to reload the issue from bd's authoritative data.\n\n- `:e` - reload if buffer unmodified, show error if modified\n- `:e!` - force reload, discarding any unsaved changes\n\n## Motivation\n\nWhen an issue is modified outside the current buffer (e.g., by another user, an LLM agent, or a CLI command), the buffer becomes stale. Users need a standard, Vim-native way to refresh the buffer content without closing and reopening it.\n\nThe `:e` family of commands is the idiomatic way to reload buffers in Vim. Supporting this for beads buffers provides a familiar UX.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **LLM updates**: Agent updates an issue via bd CLI, user wants to see changes without closing buffer\n2. **Collaborative editing**: Multiple users/agents working on issues, need to sync latest state\n3. **Undo mistakes**: User made edits they want to discard, `:e!` reverts to saved state\n4. **Checking for changes**: User suspects issue was updated externally, `:e` to refresh\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nIntercept buffer read commands for beads:// URIs and reload from bd using existing `reload_buffer_from_issue_id()` function in buffer.lua.","design":"## Technical Design\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\nAdd `BufReadCmd` autocmd in `autocmds.lua:setup()` for pattern `beads://issue/*`\n- Extracts issue ID from buffer name\n- Calls existing `buffer.reload_buffer_from_issue_id(bufnr, issue_id)`\n- Restores cursor position after reload\n\nThis autocmd fires when user runs `:e` or `:e!`, intercepting the read operation.\n\n### Behavior Details\n\n**`:e` (normal reload)**\n- Vim checks if buffer is modified before triggering BufReadCmd\n- If modified, shows standard \"No write since last change\" error\n- If unmodified, autocmd fires and reloads from bd\n\n**`:e!` (force reload)**  \n- Vim sets 'nomodified' before triggering BufReadCmd\n- Autocmd always fires, discarding any changes\n- Reloads from bd unconditionally\n\n### Integration with Existing Code\n\n- Reuses `buffer.reload_buffer_from_issue_id()` from buffer.lua:123\n- Similar pattern to existing `BufWriteCmd` autocmd for saves\n- Both read and write autocmds coexist in same autocmd group\n\n### Key Decisions\n\n1. **Cursor preservation**: Should we restore cursor position after reload? (Probably yes, matches existing save behavior)\n2. **New issue buffers**: What happens with `:e` on `beads://issue/new?type=...`? (Probably error or no-op since no ID exists)\n3. **Error handling**: How to communicate bd command failures to user? (vim.notify with ERROR level)\n4. **Modified flag**: Should reload clear the modified flag? (Yes, since we're reloading from source of truth)\n\n### Testing Focus\n\n- `:e` works when buffer unmodified\n- `:e` fails appropriately when buffer modified\n- `:e!` works and discards changes when buffer modified\n- Cursor position preserved after reload\n- Error handling when issue doesn't exist or bd fails\n- New issue buffers handled gracefully","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] `:e` reloads unmodified beads issue buffers from bd\n- [ ] `:e` shows error when buffer has unsaved changes\n- [ ] `:e!` force reloads, discarding unsaved changes\n- [ ] Cursor position preserved after reload (where possible)\n- [ ] Works for existing issue buffers (`beads://issue/\u003cid\u003e`)\n- [ ] Graceful handling of new issue buffers or errors\n- [ ] All existing tests pass\n- [ ] Integration test added for reload workflow","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-07T13:39:51.569177153-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T13:59:46.026015485-07:00"}
{"id":"nvim-beads-7g8","title":"Refactor Telescope extension to accept and preserve bd_args for refresh","description":"## Background\n\nIn the grand scheme, our goal is to create a new 'Beads execute' master low-level command that, for whitelisted commands like 'list' or 'search', will allow the user to pass command-line arguments directly to 'bd' (exposing the full range of features the tool allows) while still presenting the results in Telescope or other fancy UIs we might build in the future.\n\nOf course, by doing that, we end up duplicating a lot of what things like 'Beads list' do, so we're going to refactor those commands to ultimately use this new infra, since it's a strict functional superset.\n\nThis, then, is the very first step.\n\n## This story\n\nChange telescope/_extensions/nvim_beads/init.lua to work with bd_args in addition to filters.\n\nNotably, we have to support both because we want to pass the arguments directly to 'bd' but we may also apply client-side filters (for example 'ready' doesn't support filtering by issue type, but we want to support that so we apply that filter in the plugin).\n\nKey changes:\n- Rename list() function to show_issues(bd_args, opts)\n- Accept bd_args (e.g., {'list', '--status', 'open'}) in addition to an optional filter table\n- Execute bd command using beads.execute(bd_args)\n- Apply the optional supplied filter table to the resulting list\n- Update all action callbacks (delete, close, open, mark in-progress) to preserve and re-execute with same bd_args and filters on refresh\n- Update exports to use new function name\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- Telescope picker can be invoked with bd_args array and optional filter table\n- After mutations (close/delete/open issue), picker refreshes using same bd_args and filter table\n- Title defaults to \"Beads Issues\" or can be overridden via opts.title","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"claude","created_at":"2025-12-06T22:47:23.08024192-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-06T23:37:44.106482393-07:00","closed_at":"2025-12-06T23:37:44.106482393-07:00"}

{"id":"nvim-beads-ctb","title":"Refactor core.lua to be a pure service layer for the bd CLI","description":"### Observation\n\nThe `core.lua` module is intended to be a low-level service layer that provides a clean interface to the `bd` command-line tool. However, it contains the `create_issue` function, which is higher-level application logic. This function orchestrates fetching a template and then opening a new Neovim buffer, which goes beyond the module's primary responsibility of simply executing `bd` commands.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nRefactor `core.lua` to be a pure service layer by relocating the orchestration logic.\n\n1.  Move the implementation logic from `core.create_issue` into the `impl` function for the `create` subcommand, located in `lua/nvim-beads/commands.lua`.\n2.  The `impl` function in `commands.lua` will now be responsible for calling `core.fetch_template` and `issue.open_new_issue_buffer` (or its new location after refactoring `issue.lua`).\n3.  Remove the `create_issue` function from `core.lua` entirely.\n\n### Verification\n\n1.  All existing unit tests should pass. Test files like `spec/nvim-beads/commands_spec.lua` and `spec/nvim-beads/core_spec.lua` may require updates to reflect the moved logic.\n2.  Manually test the `:Beads create \u003ctype\u003e` command (e.g., `:Beads create feature`).

When an issue is opened in a full buffer, the blank lines are preserved, leading to an inconsistent presentation of the content.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Create a new issue with a description that contains blank lines (e.g., \"Line 1\\n\\nLine 3\").\n2. Run `:Telescope nvim_beads list`.\n3. Observe the preview for the newly created issue. The blank line between \"Line 1\" and \"Line 3\" is missing.\n4. Select the issue to open it in a full buffer.\n5. Observe that the blank line is correctly displayed in the full buffer.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe Telescope preview should render the issue body exactly as it appears in the full issue view, including any blank lines.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nThe Telescope preview collapses multiple consecutive newlines into a single one, effectively removing blank lines.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe root cause of this bug is in the `create_issue_previewer` function within `lua/telescope/_extensions/nvim_beads/init.lua`. The code responsible for splitting lines containing newlines uses the following logic:\n\n```lua\nfor subline in line:gmatch(\"[^\\n]+\") do\n    table.insert(flattened_lines, subline)\nend\n```\n\nThe pattern `[^\\n]+` matches one or more non-newline characters. When it encounters a blank line (which is essentially two consecutive newline characters `\\n\\n`), there are no characters between the newlines for the pattern to match, so the blank line is skipped.\n\nIn contrast, the `open_issue_buffer` function in `lua/nvim-beads/issue.lua` uses a more robust method to split lines while preserving blank lines, which is why the full issue view is correct.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","assignee":"Claude","created_at":"2025-12-01T21:11:23.204504016-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-02T17:38:38.532873799-07:00","closed_at":"2025-12-02T17:38:38.532873799-07:00","labels":["bug"]}

This is backwards from Telescope's typical UX where users expect the most relevant match at the bottom of the list (cursor starts at bottom, move up for less relevant).\n\nTelescope pickers with ascending strategy feel more natural because:\n- Cursor starts at the most relevant item (bottom)\n- Eyes naturally focus on the bottom of the terminal/window\n- Consistent with other Telescope pickers users are familiar with\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. **Consistency**: User switches from telescope file picker to beads picker, expects same UX\n2. **Ergonomics**: Most relevant item at bottom means less eye/cursor movement\n3. **Familiarity**: Matches muscle memory from other Telescope pickers\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nSet `sorting_strategy = \"ascending\"` in the picker options passed to `pickers.new()` in telescope extension.","design":"## Technical Design\n\n### Implementation Location\n\nIn `lua/telescope/_extensions/nvim_beads/init.lua:130-137`, add `sorting_strategy = \"ascending\"` to the options table passed to `pickers.new()`.\n\n### Telescope API Details\n\nFrom Telescope documentation:\n- `sorting_strategy`: \"Determines the direction 'better' results are sorted towards\"\n- `\"descending\"` (default): Better matches at top\n- `\"ascending\"`: Better matches at bottom\n\nThe sorter (`conf.generic_sorter`) already scores results correctly. This setting just controls display direction.\n\n### Key Decisions\n\n1. **Apply to all pickers or configurable?**: Start with hardcoded \"ascending\", allow user override via opts if needed (future enhancement)\n2. **Does this affect result order from bd?**: No, only affects Telescope display. bd command output order is unchanged.\n3. **User override**: Should we let users pass `sorting_strategy` in opts? Probably yes for flexibility\n\n### Testing Focus\n\n- Verify most relevant item appears at bottom in picker\n- Verify cursor starts at bottom (Telescope handles this automatically with ascending)\n- Test with various bd commands (list, search, ready, blocked)\n- Ensure user can override via opts if desired","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Telescope picker uses `sorting_strategy = \"ascending\"`\n- [ ] Most relevant results appear at bottom of picker\n- [ ] Cursor starts at bottom item by default\n- [ ] Works for all bd commands (list, search, ready, blocked)\n- [ ] User can override via opts if needed\n- [ ] All existing tests pass\n- [ ] Manual testing confirms improved UX","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-07T13:46:37.254112325-07:00","updated_at":"2025-12-07T13:59:45.853456635-07:00","closed_at":"2025-12-07T13:59:45.853456635-07:00"}
