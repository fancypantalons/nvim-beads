1. Introduction                                   *nvim-beads-introduction*

nvim-beads is a Neovim plugin that integrates with bd (beads)--a
lightweight, git-friendly issue tracker. It's particularly useful if you're
tired of context-switching to your browser just to check your backlog.

bd stores issues in a simple `.beads/issues.jsonl` file that stays in sync
with your git repo. No external services, no complex databases, just a
JSONL file you can commit alongside your code.

This plugin provides a Telescope-based interface for browsing and managing
those issues without leaving Neovim.

==============================================================================
2. Features                                        *nvim-beads-feature-list*

Here's what you get:

- Browse and filter issues using Telescope (because Telescope makes
  everything better)
- View ready/unblocked issues so you know what to work on next
- Create new issues without leaving your editor
- Edit issue details in markdown-formatted buffers--just edit and save
- Filter by status, type, priority, assignee using natural language
- Fast lazy-loading so it doesn't slow down your startup
- Clean Lua API if you want to script things yourself

==============================================================================
3. Requirements                                     *nvim-beads-requirements*

You'll need:

- Neovim >= 0.8.0 (obviously)
- The bd command-line tool installed and in your PATH
  Grab it from: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads
- telescope.nvim (this is NOT optional--the whole UI is built around it)
  Get it here: https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim

==============================================================================
4. Installation                                          *nvim-beads-install*

Using lazy.nvim:
>lua
    {
        "brettk/nvim-beads",
        dependencies = {
            "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", -- Required
        },
        cmd = "Beads",
    }
<

==============================================================================
5. Quick Start                                       *nvim-beads-quick-start*

First, you'll need to initialize bd in your project (if you haven't already):
>bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    bd init
<

That creates a `.beads/` directory with your issue database. Go ahead and
commit that--it's meant to be version controlled.

Now, from Neovim:
>vim
    " Browse issues (requires telescope.nvim)
    :Beads list                 " All open issues
    :Beads list ready           " Ready (unblocked) issues
    :Beads list bugs            " All bugs
    :Beads list open features   " Open features

    " View/edit a specific issue
    :Beads show bd-123

    " Create a new issue
    :Beads create bug
<

A quick note: `:Beads list` is really just a convenience wrapper that
auto-loads the Telescope extension and calls it for you. So this:
>vim
    :Beads list ready
<

Is exactly the same as this:
>vim
    :lua require("telescope").load_extension("nvim_beads")
    :Telescope nvim_beads list status=ready
<

Use whichever you prefer. Most folks find `:Beads list` easier to remember.

==============================================================================
6. Commands                                            *nvim-beads-commands*

                                                                    *:Beads*
:Beads {subcommand} [args]
                        Execute a beads subcommand. See below for the full
                        list of what's available.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List Subcommand ~
                                                              *:Beads-list*

:Beads list [status] [type]

                        Browse and filter issues using a natural language
                        interface. This is the main command you'll use for
                        finding and opening issues.

                        It's really just a convenience wrapper around the
                        Telescope extension (`:Telescope nvim_beads list`),
                        but it's easier to type and remember.

                        Arguments are positional but flexible--the parser is
                        smart enough to figure out whether you're specifying
                        a status or a type, so the order doesn't actually
                        matter.

                        Valid statuses:
                          • open - Issues you haven't started yet
                          • in_progress - What you're working on now
                          • blocked - Waiting on something else
                          • closed - Done and dusted
                          • ready - Unblocked and ready to go
                          • stale - Been sitting there a while
                          • all - Everything

                        Valid types:
                          • bug/bugs - Something's broken
                          • feature/features - Something new
                          • task/tasks - Work that needs doing
                          • epic/epics - Big hairy features
                          • chore/chores - Maintenance and cleanup
                          • all - All of 'em

                        Use singular or plural, doesn't matter. The parser
                        handles both.

Examples:
>vim
    :Beads list                " Show all open issues (default)
    :Beads list ready          " Show ready (unblocked) issues
    :Beads list bugs           " Show all bugs
    :Beads list open bugs      " Show open bugs
    :Beads list ready features " Show ready features
    :Beads list closed         " Show closed issues
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create Subcommand ~
                                                            *:Beads-create*

:Beads create {type}
                        Create a new issue. This opens a buffer with a
                        template that you fill in, then save to create the
                        issue. Pretty straightforward.

                        Valid types: bug, feature, task, epic, chore

                        The template's in markdown and has fields for:
                          • Title
                          • Description
                          • Priority (0-4)
                          • Status
                          • Dependencies

                        Just fill it in and save. Done.

Examples:
>vim
    :Beads create bug
    :Beads create feature
    :Beads create task
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Show Subcommand ~
                                                             *:Beads-show*

:Beads show {issue-id}
                        Open a specific issue by ID. You get a markdown
                        buffer with all the issue details. Edit it, save it,
                        and the changes go straight back to the database.

                        Simple as that.

Examples:
>vim
    :Beads show bd-123
    :Beads show bd-abc
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open Subcommand ~
                                                             *:Beads-open*

:Beads open {issue-id}
                        Alias for |:Beads-show|. Opens a specific issue
                        by ID in a buffer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Passthrough Subcommands ~
                                                      *:Beads-passthrough*

The following subcommands just pass through to bd directly and show you
the output in a scratch buffer:

:Beads compact          Compact the issues database
:Beads cleanup          Clean up orphaned dependencies
:Beads sync             Sync issues with git
:Beads daemon           Start the bd daemon

==============================================================================
7. Lua API                                               *nvim-beads-lua-api*

nvim-beads has a public Lua API if you want to integrate it into your own
plugins or scripts. It's pretty straightforward.

For the complete API docs, check out:
- |nvim-beads_api.txt| - Public Lua API reference
- |nvim-beads_commands.txt| - Command implementation details

Quick example to get you started:
>lua
    local beads = require("nvim-beads")

    -- List issues with filters
    beads.list({ status = "ready", type = "bug" })

    -- Show a specific issue
    beads.show("bd-123")

    -- Create a new issue
    beads.create({ type = "feature" })

    -- Execute arbitrary bd command
    local result = beads.execute({ "list", "--status", "open" })
<

See |nvim-beads_api.txt| for the full details.

==============================================================================
8. Telescope Integration                       *nvim-beads-telescope-integration*

Telescope is the heart of this plugin--all issue browsing goes through it.
The `:Beads list` command is just sugar that auto-loads the extension and
calls Telescope for you.

If you want to load the extension manually (maybe you like doing things
the hard way?):
>lua
    require("telescope").load_extension("nvim_beads")
<

You can also call it directly:
>vim
    " Browse all issues
    :Telescope nvim_beads list

    " Browse with filters
    :Telescope nvim_beads list status=ready
    :Telescope nvim_beads list type=bug
    :Telescope nvim_beads list status=open type=feature
<

Or via Lua:
>lua
    local telescope = require("telescope")

    -- Browse all issues
    telescope.extensions.nvim_beads.list()

    -- With filters
    telescope.extensions.nvim_beads.list({
        status = "ready",
        type = "bug"
    })
<

Telescope Keymaps ~

While you're browsing issues in the Telescope picker, you've got these
keymaps available:

  <CR>    Open the issue (you know, the obvious one)
  d       Delete it (asks for confirmation first, don't worry)
  c       Mark it closed
  o       Reopen it
  i       Mark as in-progress

==============================================================================
9. Configuration                                          *nvim-beads-config*

Good news: there's basically no configuration needed. It just works.

All the actual issue tracking behavior is controlled by bd itself, not the
plugin. So if you want to tweak how bd works, check out its docs:
